## Import Information:

video_recap.py makes use of the transcript generated by Youtube through the import of YoutubeTranscriptApi, 
meaning this application will not work if captions are entirely disabled.
Pytubefix gives access to YouTube videos and lets you retrieve basic information about the video content.
YoutubeTranscriptApi allows access to using youtube's captions or transcripts and allows the code to read it.
SentenceTransformers is the natural language model used to summarize the transcript through the use of api keys.


## Running the Application:
After completing all preresiquites and installation, video_recap.py will give a prompt to enter a url. 
Be free to enter any type of youtube video and copy the link into the terminal. Upon entering, the
VideoRecap will first verify information about the video including how many lines the video contains.
Then the summary will be contained in a file of the source folder containing the completed summary of the video.
